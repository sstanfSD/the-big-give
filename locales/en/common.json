Whatever you do, make it free.",

  "about.history.title": "History of the Big Give",
  "about.history.paragraph1": "The idea of a citywide \"Big Give\" dates back to 2009. A local church in Ottawa had just completed The 40 Days of Community by Rick Warren. The challenge at the end of the book study was to find a church-wide project that would reach the community in a unique way.",

  "about.history.paragraph2": "Kathy Blakely woke up early one morning with the idea of a free garage sale. It was something that was easy to do and wouldn't cost the church a lot of money. As she shared her vision with others, it became evident that this was a \"God idea.\" The first Big Give was held that year, and Kathy had a dream to see churches all over the city do the same thing on the same day.",

  "about.history.paragraph3": "In 2014, Richard Long of Love Ottawa heard of the idea and approached Kathy about partnering together. A committee was formed, and in June of 2015, 55 churches across the nation's capital joined together for a unified day of radical giving.",

Our Big Give events are first and foremost environments for showing God's love through practical and tangible acts of kindness and generosity.",

We also pay a small administration fee to One Way Ministries who host our registration site, make website improvements and provide human resources to handle important communication with our church partners. In addition, a small number of churches cannot afford the registration fee so we try to facilitate their partnership. Simply stated – without your registration fee The Big Give would not exist.",
